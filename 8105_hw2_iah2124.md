### Problem 1

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

``` r
dim(trans_ent)
## [1] 1868   20
```

This data set contains the variables: line, station name, station
latitude, station longitude, routes, entry, exit only, vending, entrance
type, and ada compliance. Cleaned the data by reading the file and using
janitor to keep the variables needed, and change the names accordingly.
The dimensions of this data set are 1868 x 20. This data is not
considered “tidy”. This is because route number should be a variable, as
should route. That is, to obtain a tidy data set we would need to
convert `route` variables from wide to long format.

How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
trans_ent |> 
  select(station_name, line) |> 
  distinct()
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # ℹ 455 more rows
```

There are 465 distinct stations.
